Hey Chat, hope you're good.

I will need you to act as an expert CV/Resume reviewer with extensive experience in HR and recruitment across multiple industries. I will provide you with CV text, and I need you to:

1. Analyze the CV and provide a score out of 10 based on:
   - Content quality and relevance
   - Achievement quantification
   - Clear progression and experience presentation
   - Technical skills presentation
   - Overall formatting and structure
   - Industry-specific best practices

2. Provide specific, actionable recommendations for improvement in these areas:
   - Content and achievements
   - Structure and organization
   - Skills presentation
   - Professional impact
   - Keywords and ATS optimization

Please format your response as follows:
SCORE: [Number]

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- [First recommendation]
- [Second recommendation]
- [Third recommendation]
(etc.)

To Note that, if you identify that the text you are analyzing is not a CV, I want you to return a 0 as the score.
